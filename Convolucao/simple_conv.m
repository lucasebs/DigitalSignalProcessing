% SIMPLE CONVOLUTION FUNCTION conv(x,h)

% -
% Receive two vectors and show on screen a new vector resultant of 
% convolution operation
function simple_conv(f, g)

  % Transform the vectors f and g in new vectors with the same length
  F = [f,zeros(1,length(g))]; 
  G = [g,zeros(1,length(f))]; 

  % FOR Loop to put the result of convolution between F and G vectors 
  % in a new vector C. According to the convolution operation characteristics,
  % the length of a resultant vector of convolution operation between two vector
  % is the sum of vectors length minus 1
  for i=1:length(g)+length(f)-1
    % Create a new vector C
    C(i) = 0;
    % FOR Loop to walk through the vector F ang G
    for j=1:length(f)
      if(i-j+1>0)
        C(i) = C(i) + F(j) * G(i-j+1);
      else
      end
    end   
  end

  % Show C vector on screen
